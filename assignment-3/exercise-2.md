> You want to test your new DSL that teaches kids how to program. You ask some friends who also take CS410 to solve a series of tasks using the DSL. You record them on video while they are working on the tasks so that you can show their mistakes in your final video.

- The participants may feel uncomfortable and embarrassed about how their mistakes are recorded and shown to the whole class.
- If the video contains the participants' personal information (e.g. their names, faces and voices), there may be privacy concerns. 
- My friends cannot make their decision to participate truly voluntarily because they do not want to let me down.

> A professor wants to find out if using a lie detector during online exams is more effective at catching cheaters than using an online proctoring tool. Since it is unclear if the lie detector works accurately, the professor guarantees that students who volunteer to use the lie detector during the midterm will not be penalized if they get caught cheating (no matter if they did cheat or if it was a false positive).

- The students cannot make their decision to participate truly voluntarily since the professor controls their grades.
- The professor's proposal may constitute academic misconduct because actual cheating may be tolerated during the midterm.
- The students may be under emotional stress and perform poorly on the midterm due to the presence of the lie detector (and the possibility that the detector could have false positives).

> You want to test a new software that measures productivity. For 1 week, you ask participants youâ€™ve recruited in your company to run your tool in the background and at the end of each work day rate on a scale from 1 to 10 how productive they were. After the week, you show each participant their ratings compared to their real productivity. You guarantee that none of the information will be shared with their employer and that the results will be anonymized.

- If their "real productivity" is low, the participants may feel bad about themselves.
- Running the tool in the background may violate the company's regulations. Some companies forbid the use of external, unauthorized software.
- The participants cannot make their decision to participate truly voluntarily because they are my colleagues and do not want to let me down.
