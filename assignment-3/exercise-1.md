> You want to find out if using an IDE makes developers more productive. You randomly select 50 developers and ask them if they use an IDE and how productive they feel (on a scale from 1 to 10). The 47 that use an IDE rate their productivity on average as 6.9 out of 10 while the 3 that don’t use an IDE rate it as 6.7 out of 10. You therefore conclude that IDE users are slightly more productive.

- Type: survey
- Threats to validity
  - Internal validity: The low productivity rating of the 3 developers who do not use an IDE may not be a direct result of not using an IDE. There could be confounding variables. For example, maybe these developers come from companies who cannot not afford IDE subscriptions. Their low productivity could be negatively impacted by the companies' low budget but is not a direct result of not using an IDE.
  - Construct validity: The study is not measuring the correct concept. The study should measure how productive the developers **actually** are. But the study instead measures how productive they **feel**. Whether they feel productive does not necessarily indicate whether they actually work productively.
  - External validity: The low-productive group consists of only 3 developers, making the study's results un-generalizable.

> You want to analyze if there is a correlation between the amount of times code is changed and the amounts of bugs it contains. You extract the commit histories of 100 randomly selected, reasonably large projects on Github, as well as the number of reported bugs in the bug trackers associated with these projects. You do clean your data, i.e. you remove duplicate bug reports or commits that didn’t change the code. You find that there is a strong correlation between the number of commits and the number of reported bugs, so you conclude that frequent changes are likely to introduce more bugs.

- Type: historical data collection and analysis
- Threats to validity
  - Internal validity: Correlation does not necessarily imply causation. The fact that there is a "strong correlation between the number of commits and the number of reported bugs" does not mean there is a casual relationship between them.

> You want to test your new DSL can be used to teach kids how to program. You select 20 random developers and, without any introduction, ask them to solve a series of tasks (that you would want kids to learn) using the DSL. 19 of the developers successfully solve all the tasks without any difficulties. You conclude that your new DSL perfectly fits its purpose since it was very easy to use.

- Type: observational study
- Threats to validity
  - External validity: the study involves adult developers. Therefore, the study's results cannot be generalized to kids.
  - Construct validity: we could also argue that the study violates construct validity. The study is not measuring the right thing, i.e. how kids receive the DSL. Instead, the study measures how adult developers receive the DSL.
